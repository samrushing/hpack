HPACK
=====

An implementation of HPACK in Python/Cython.

Note
----

This code is in progress.

Purpose
-------

I plan on writing a fast implementation in Cython for Shrapnel.  The
python code is a prototype for that code.  Hopefully the result (and
ASCII huffman table) are simple enough that people can translate it to
C/C++ without too much trouble.
